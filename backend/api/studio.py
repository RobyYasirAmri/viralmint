"""Smart Video Studio API.

Every project read/write returns the envelope from studio_store.envelope:
`{project: {id, title, status, revision, doc, derived, checks, media, …}}`.

Edits go through PATCH as ops under optimistic concurrency (`if_revision`);
work that takes time (planning, voice takes, the render) has its own
endpoint and runs as a job whose result lands back through internal ops.

Errors: every refusal is `{"detail": {"code", "message", …}}` (studio_error),
so the editor can branch on the code and always has a sentence to show.
