"""Smart Video Studio — what blocks a render, and what's worth knowing first.

One function answers both for every surface: the editor's Render dialog
reads `checks` from the project envelope, and the render endpoint refuses
with the same first blocker — so the button and the server can't disagree.

  * blockers: a scene with no line, a scene with no usable visual, anything
    still generating.
  * warnings: lines changed since they were voiced, scenes not voiced yet
    (both voiced at render), a music bed on with no track picked.

Pure: the take cache is passed in (`take_known`) — it decides whether a `ready`
scene's own take still exists (a cleared cache means it is re-voiced).
